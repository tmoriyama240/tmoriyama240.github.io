# Taka Moriyama

Hello! I am a Ph.D. student of history at Florida State University. My major is American history, investigating U.S. politics during the 1960s and 1970. My interests lie in politics, conservatism, and media.

I am originally from Japan. I moved to Florida in the summer of 2012 to enter the graduate school of FSU. I like traveling, driving across the nation to do research at archives and libraries. I also love to take pictures in my trips.
